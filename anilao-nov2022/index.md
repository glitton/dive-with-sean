Scuba diving Anilao brings back childhood memories of when it would take at least four hours to drive from Manila to Anilao Batangas due to the terrible roads. Back then (early 80s) there were not many resorts that I can remember. In fact, I remember sleeping on the beach. Today, rows of resorts front the ocean and driving to Anilao be done in two hours.

Many of my American scuba diving photographer friends have raved about staying at Crystal Blue Resort home of the famous underwater photographer, Mike Bartick. So I checked it out this trip.

Anilao is really a macro photographer's playground. You won't be tired of finding those tiny subjects from pygmy seahorses, various nudibranchs to tiny chrimp and crabs living in anemonies.

I had a blast and would definitely return!
