It's been a year since Sean passed away last Nov. 6, 2021. To commemorate Sean's life and our love for him, we planned a dive memorial where in we would dive his favorite spot in Anila called Batok to Beatrice. Both family and friends spent the weekend at the lovely <a href="" target="_blank">Solitude Acacia Hotel in Anlilao Batangas</a>

Once you see movement, you have to be patient and wait for them to stick their heads out a bit more as they are curious little critters.

I also spotted what I think is a mantis shrimp. This one in particular was so tiny that I couldn't see it clearly so wasn't sure what it was until I got to editing.

I also saw this other blue shrimp whose name is unknown.

Other not so tiny things that are emblematic of the Caribbean include the flamingo tongue slug

and the Christmas tree worm ![xmastree_worm](./xmastree_worm.jpg)

Lastly, I got to see some interesting kissing fish behavior which is actually a sign of territorial fighting.

So nice to be back in the Caribbean!
