Ever since I got to know the cuteness of the caribbean blenny (thanks to my dive buddy Linda Elliot :clap:), I've been hunting for them everytime I get my feet wet in the Caribbean waters. :ocean:

The Scuba Club Cozumel house reef has so many of them that it was so cool to be able to see a number of them at one time. :fire:

I did an afternoon dive and took a heading of 320 degrees from the shore staircase, swam to the end of the right-hand side buoy and dropped down to 20 feet. Note that my wife, Leslie, was watching me the whole time. Normally, I would never dive alone :exclamation:

Below the buoy marker is a sunken pier which looked like it was damaged from a hurricane:question:

The structure is now an artificial reef teeming with all the usual Caribbean critters.

Best buddies: The highhat fish (not a drum, as I originally thought) and arrow crab

Trumpet fish

However, I had one mission, photograph the cute blennies! :boom:

The house reef did not disappoint. I had more than 50 shots and it was very difficult to narrow them down. Here are a few of my favorites :heart_eyes:

This shot made me think that this blenny was crying, oh no!

This blenny was trying to scream at me to get off her lawn!

This is one shy blennie.
