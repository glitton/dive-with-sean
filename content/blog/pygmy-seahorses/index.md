One of the little animals that you are guaranteed to see (especially if you have a good spotter) when diving in Anilao is the pygmy seahorse or the Hippocampus Bargibanti. During this dive trip, I saw two varieties. The typical gray/light purple with the pink bumps (they are called tubercles) which I saw at the dive site Kirby's Rock and also at Koala.

And a yellow one which we saw at the dive site Old Bethlehem. The Hippocampus Denise, also known as Denise's pygmy seahorse or the yellow pygmy seahorse is a wee bit bigger than the other one. I was able to spot this variety with my own eyes, although I did have a macro lens so it was much easier! ðŸ”Ž

For perspective, check out the size of the pygmy seahorse as compared to the pointy stick used by my spotter dive master.

Some fun facts about pygmy seahorses (source: <a href="https://oceana.org/marine-life/pygmy-seahorse/" target="_blank">oceana.org</a>):

1. Bargibantâ€™s pygmy seahorses live between 52.5 to 131 feet (16-40 m) deep.
2. Bargibantâ€™s pygmy seahorses grow to a maximum length 0.94 inches (2.4 cm).
3. Bargibantâ€™s pygmy seahorses take the color of whichever species of gorgonian corals they live on.
4. Unlike other seahorses, male pygmy seahorses use a pouch in their trunk â€“ not their tail â€“ to brood their young.
5. The Bargibantâ€™s pygmy seahorse was discovered accidentally in 1969 on a gorgonian coral being examined and was the first pygmy seahorse species to be discovered.
