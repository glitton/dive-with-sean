You either love scuba diving in Monterey or hate it. It took me a while to get to the "love it" stage but I'm there! So whenever I get a chance to dive Monterey, I do it.

It is common to have visibility in the 10 feet to 30 feet range. Most of the time the viz is what we call "pea soup" greenish at the top but then it can open up to 30+ feet viz in the bottom.

I recently dove in May using my late nephew's drysuit which he modeled below.

I had the boots changed to fit my feet as well as have the arms and legs shorted and finally added new neck and wrist seals. The suit fit comfortably although still a bit big in the chest. More importantly it kept me warm and dry!
