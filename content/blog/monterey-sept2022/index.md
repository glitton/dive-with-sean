Since I've been spending half the year in Puerto Morelos Mexico, traveling back to San Francisco and scuba diving Monterey has been quite the treat!

During my birthday weekend, I decided to spend it scuba diving. We dove metridium mountain where I got to see a very cute but shy female wolf eel peek through her hole.

I patiently waited for her to come out a bit more so I can a better close up shot of her. ![wolf eel close](./wolfeel_hole2.jpg)

The white metridiums ![metridium](./metridium.jpg)

and the bright orange sponges gave quite the contrast to the dark waters.

I even got up close and personal with a lingcod who was so content having a staring contest with me.

Hoping to be back sometime in October.
