I've been diving Cozumel since 2015 and each time I come back, it feels like the first time. For this December 2021 trip, we opted to stay at the <a href="https://www.scubaclubcozumel.com" target="_blank">Scuba Club Cozumel</a> as it was very convenient. Eat, sleep, dive, repeat!

Plus Leslie loves lounging on a hammock under the palapa. Happy wife, happy life :-)

Sean was with me and I am sure he enjoyed all the dives.

The highlight of this trip's dive was seeing the seahorse "gallop" its way in the sand to hang on to this one piece of sea grass!

I also did a night dive at the Scuba Club Cozumel house reef. I was so excited to see this squid in all its colorful glory.

And as we were ready to wrap our dive, this guy showed up!
