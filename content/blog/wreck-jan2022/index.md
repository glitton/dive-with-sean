I love diving the C-56 in Puerto Morelos as I still have yet to take a good wreck shot. I think these shots were a bit better but not yet National Geographic ready!

This time I focused more on getting shots with people in it. ![Delphine](./delphine.jpg) :smile:

Thanks to my dive buddies for allowing me to take photos of them!

Plus the boat captain, Mr. Rana, accidently took a shot of me which I thought was so cool!
