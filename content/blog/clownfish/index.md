description: "Should Marlin have become Marlina?"
---

I learned that all clownfish are born male and then become female when the male's partner dies. Thus, Nemo's father, Marlin, should've turned into a female, Marlina. Interesting, eh?

You likely have seen clownfish inside anemones. I learned that they have a very symbiotic relationship wherein the while the clownfish provides the anemone nutrients in the form of waste while also scaring off potential predator fish.The anemone provides the clownfish with protection and shelter.

We should all be like clownfish and anemones, helping each other out get the best of living in this world!
