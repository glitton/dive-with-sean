This is my first post since Sean passed away unexpectedly last November 6, 2021. Sean joined me in spirit diving Puerto Morelos' Fish Market.

Oh, and here's a cool pic that is emblematic of this dive site.

Depths reach up to 35 feet with some soft corals and large schools of fish, mostly yellow grunts. Water temperature was in the low 80s (in Fahrenheit) thus a 3mm wet suit worked well.

This is a great dive site for the novice diver and a very nice site to practice wide angle photography.

As always, I felt safe and sound diving with [Omdelfin](https://omdelfin.com/).
