I've been to a number of cenotes since I've been visiting and now living in Mexico. A cenote, pronounced as “seh-no-tay”, is a natural sinkhole looking like an underground chamber or cave containing fresh water with a temperature of 77 degree fahrenheit. It's a great way to cool off during the hot summers in Mexico but you can also go scuba diving in them!

My favorites are right in my hometown of Puerto Morelos, Cenote Zapote and Maravilla. Unfortunately, Maravilla was closed due to an accident so we went to Cenote Kin-Ha instead which to my surprise was very cool! :smile:

What makes Zapote aka Hells Bells so interesting is that the formations have shapes resembling bells, lampshades or even an elephant's feet. This dive is best done with nitrox as depths can go to as much as 115 feet.

Check out the video of this dive which I did with my neighbor Walt and Andres of OmDelfin.

Since Maravilla was closed, I didn't know what to expect diving Cenote Kin-ha. To my surprise, it was just as cavernous as Marvilla! The highlight for me was seeing the ray of light shining through showing activity from the free divers.
