Scuba diving Anilao brings back childhood memories of when it would take at least four hours to drive from Manila to Anilao Batangas due to the terrible roads. Back then (early 80s) there were not many resorts that I can remember. In fact, I remember sleeping on the beach. Today, rows of resorts front the ocean and driving to Anilao be done in two hours.

Many of my American scuba diving photographer friends have raved about staying at Crystal Blue Resort home of the famous underwater photographer, Mike Bartick. So I checked it out this trip. The verdict? It's an eat, sleep, dive, take photos, repeat sort of place, you definitely get the best bang for your peso, so it was perfect for me. :smile:

Anilao is really a macro photographer's playground; it's known as the nudibranch capital of the world housing over 100 species. Nudibranchs are a group of soft-bodied marine gastropod molluscs which shed their shells after their larval stage (source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudibranch" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>)

Here are thumnbails of the various nudies I found during this trip
